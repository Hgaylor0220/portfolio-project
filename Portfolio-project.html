    	<h2>About Me:</h2>
			<p>Hello! My name is Hailey Gaylor!! I am 27 and as you could already asume I have a huge floofy dog named Ebba Beryl.. Ebba is a 6 month Great Pyernees that is the second love of my life. We enjoy hiking, taking pictures and eating lots of great food! My first love is Meeko, he is a 8 year old cat that is also super floofy! We enjoy gardening, sleeping in and watching all of the movies. Out side of spending time with the two loves of my lifes I work a 9-6 job as a Assistant manager for  bank and take a Programming course on the side. Here are  few things I am learning and interested learning.</p>
